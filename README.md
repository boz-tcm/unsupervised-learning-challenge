> Project: Module 6 PyViz Proptech challenge assignment

> Purpose: In this activity, we used our newfound Python PyViz skills to create a Python script in Jupyter Notebook for the purpose of developing the following:
>1. One-click service for people to buy and rent properties in San Francisco, with the potential to expand the product to other U.S. markets.
